# Flask--WebDiaries
This is a flask blog application "called CS Web Diaries". 

-Using Python and Flask framework to build a dynamic blog site that can allow computer science students to
post content and guide each other.

-Implementing a database system using SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL to allow data storage and update
features. This would also allow multiple user access and form input/output features.

# Note

-This project is still In-Progress and has not been completed yet. Only part of it has been completed.

-This project is a part of the Flask Tutorial series provided by CoreyMSchafer on Youtube. The code I have given is similar to that he teaches in his tutorials. I am still learning it while I code it but I have manually written all the code down. The end goal is to finish the tutorials by 15th October and making a completely new fresh code from scratch that would implement a different UI and would be specific to my own  Blog application idea. 

-The code is a follow along with code that I have been working for 3 weeks. I intend to finish it in 2 weeks and write my own version of the code once I am confident with Flask
